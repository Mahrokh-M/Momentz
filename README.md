## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/momentz.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd momentz
   ```
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure `requirements.txt` includes `django` and `pyodbc` (e.g., `pip install django pyodbc`).
5. **Set up SQL Server**:
   - Install [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (e.g., Express edition).
   - Install [ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server).
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Create a database named `momentz_db`:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE momentz_db;
     ```
   - Update the database configuration in `settings.py`:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         "default": {
             "ENGINE": "mssql",
             "NAME": "momentz_db",
             "USER": "your_sql_server_username",
             "PASSWORD": "your_sql_server_password",
             "HOST": r"localhost\SQLEXPRESS",
             "OPTIONS": {
                 "driver": "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server",
             },
         }
     }
     ```
     Replace `your_sql_server_username` and `your_sql_server_password` with your SQL Server credentials. You can also leave them empty if you're using window's authentication for ssms connection.
6. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
7. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
